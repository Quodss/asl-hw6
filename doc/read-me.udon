- Author: ~dozreg-toplud
- contains:
  - %delta app from previous lessons;
  - unit tests;

Poke examples:
To add a value to the state:
```
:delta &delta-action [%push ~zod 5]
```

To delete the latest added value:

Poke the app with `+dbug` to inspect its state. Test the app with `-test /=delta=/tests ~`
